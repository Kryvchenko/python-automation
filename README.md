## Setup
 - Make sure that your Chrome browser version is the same as the ChromeDriver version in the current directory (feel free to update it if needed).
- For each task, various libraries were installed. You can find them at the top of the .py files, and you can install them using `pip install package-name-here` or your preferred package manager.
- For tasks involving WhatsApp automation, I would recommend creating a virtual environment.
